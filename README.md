# AHA Data

This repository houses code and other supporting documentation for importing and cleaning data from the AHA annual surveys, as well as information on hospital mergers and closures based on the AHA summary of changes files. The directory structure and description is listed below:

- **data**: includes descriptions of datasets used and links to raw sources where possible. This folder is separated into "inputs" (raw data) and "outputs" (clean data files available for analysis)
- **data-code**: code files and supporting documentation for all data wrangling, cleaning, and management
